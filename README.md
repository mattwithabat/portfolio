# mattwithabat - Portfolio

My personal portfolio website showcasing Minecraft plugins and development work.

## About Me

I'm a Minecraft server owner turned plugin developer. I started coding plugins because I couldn't find exactly what I needed for my server. Now I build tools that just work—no bloat, no confusion.

Specializing in performance, clean code, and plugins that don't break on updates.
